# prolog-example
## Introduction
These are simple prolog programs that I either tried or used.
There are 4 files here:
* README.md - this is this read me file having some information about what are here
* hello.pl - (swi-prolog specific) a simple "Hello World" http server. It listen on
port 5000. Be sure to read the code before running it (it is the thing to do when 
you get a new source code.)
* hellodebug.pl - (swi-prolog specific) hello.pl with rudimentary debug. Obviously, it is "swi-prolog" specific
* program.pl - (gprolog and swi-prolog) a sample program my mentor wrote and I help maintained it. It is a bit
messy. So there.
